# YOLO26 INT8 Calibration Dataset Configuration
#
# This YAML file defines the calibration dataset for TensorRT INT8 quantization.
# TensorRT uses representative images during calibration to determine optimal
# scaling factors for INT8 quantization, which affects model accuracy.
#
# Calibration Requirements:
# - Requires 100-500 representative images from the target domain
# - Images should cover the typical distribution of inputs (lighting, angles, objects)
# - More diverse calibration data generally leads to better INT8 accuracy
#
# For home security, the synthetic dataset covers:
# - Normal activities: deliveries, pets, residents, vehicles, yard work
# - Suspicious activities: casing, loitering, prowling, tailgating
# - Threats: break-in attempts, package theft, vandalism, weapons
#
# Note: For videos, run export_tensorrt.py with --extract-frames to extract
# frames before calibration.

# Base path for calibration images
# In production, point to extracted frames from synthetic videos
path: /home/msvoboda/github/nemotron-v3-home-security-intelligence/data/synthetic

# Training and validation paths (relative to 'path')
# The calibration process uses images from these directories
train: .
val: .

# COCO class names for security-relevant objects
# Maps class IDs to names for objects detected in home security monitoring
# Only security-relevant classes are included (9 of 80 COCO classes)

# Calibration Notes:
# -----------------
# 1. INT8 quantization typically achieves 2x throughput vs FP16 with <1% mAP drop
# 2. Calibration images should be 640x640 (or your target inference resolution)
# 3. Run calibration on the same GPU architecture as deployment
# 4. TensorRT caches calibration data in .cache files for subsequent exports
#
# Expected Performance (RTX A5500):
# - FP16: 10-20ms inference, ~2GB VRAM
# - INT8: 5-10ms inference, ~1.5GB VRAM
#
# Export Commands:
# ---------------
# See ai/yolo26/export_tensorrt.py for the export script.
#
# Basic INT8 export:
#   python ai/yolo26/export_tensorrt.py --int8 --data config/yolo26_calibration.yaml
#
# With frame extraction from videos:
#   python ai/yolo26/export_tensorrt.py --int8 --data config/yolo26_calibration.yaml --extract-frames
