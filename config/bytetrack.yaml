# ByteTrack Configuration for Security Monitoring
# ByteTrack is a fast, motion-based tracker that uses BYTE association
# (matching every detection box including low-confidence ones).
#
# Use ByteTrack when:
# - ReID is not needed (single camera, simple scenes)
# - Maximum speed is required
# - GPU memory is constrained
#

tracker_type: bytetrack

# =============================================================================
# Re-Identification (ReID) Settings
# =============================================================================
# ByteTrack can optionally use ReID, but typically runs without it
# for maximum speed. Set to false for pure motion-based tracking.

with_reid: false

# =============================================================================
# Detection Thresholds
# =============================================================================
# ByteTrack's key innovation: using ALL detection boxes through
# a two-stage association process

# Minimum confidence for high-quality detections (first association)
# Range: 0.3 - 0.7, recommended: 0.5
track_high_thresh: 0.5

# Minimum confidence for low-quality detections (second association)
# ByteTrack's BYTE method uses these low-confidence detections to
# recover tracks that might be occluded or partially visible
# Range: 0.05 - 0.2, recommended: 0.1
track_low_thresh: 0.1

# Threshold for initializing new tracks
# Only detections above this confidence start new tracks
# Range: 0.5 - 0.7, recommended: 0.6
new_track_thresh: 0.6

# =============================================================================
# Track Management
# =============================================================================
# Track buffer: frames to keep lost tracks before deletion
# ByteTrack uses motion prediction to maintain tracks during brief occlusions
# Range: 15 - 45 frames, recommended: 30 for 30fps footage
track_buffer: 30

# =============================================================================
# Association Thresholds
# =============================================================================
# Matching threshold for IoU-based association
# ByteTrack relies heavily on IoU, so this is critical
# Range: 0.7 - 0.9, recommended: 0.8
match_thresh: 0.8

# Performance Comparison: ByteTrack vs BoT-SORT
# =============================================================================
#
# | Metric              | ByteTrack | BoT-SORT |
# |---------------------|-----------|----------|
# | Speed               | Fast      | Moderate |
# | GPU Memory          | Low       | Higher   |
# | Occlusion Handling  | Good      | Better   |
# | Cross-camera ReID   | No        | Yes      |
# | ID Switches         | More      | Fewer    |
# | Implementation      | Simple    | Complex  |
#
# Recommendation:
# - Use ByteTrack for single-camera deployments with good visibility
# - Use BoT-SORT for multi-camera systems or scenes with heavy occlusion

# Performance Tuning for Security Applications
# =============================================================================
# Notes for production deployment:
#
# 1. For high-frame-rate cameras (60+ fps):
#    - Decrease track_buffer to 15-20
#    - Can increase match_thresh to 0.85 (predictions more accurate)
#
# 2. For low-frame-rate cameras (10-15 fps):
#    - Increase track_buffer to 45-60
#    - Decrease match_thresh to 0.7 (larger motion between frames)
#
# 3. For scenes with frequent occlusions:
#    - Decrease track_low_thresh to 0.05
#    - Increase track_buffer to 45
#
# 4. For clean scenes with well-separated objects:
#    - Increase track_high_thresh to 0.6
#    - Decrease track_buffer to 20
