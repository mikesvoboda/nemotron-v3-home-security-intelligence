# =============================================================================
# Jinja2 Sandbox Escape Vulnerabilities
# =============================================================================
# These CVEs relate to Jinja2's sandbox mode which this application does not use.
# We use Jinja2 only via FastAPI's template rendering with trusted templates.
# The sandboxed environment bypass is not exploitable in our use case.

CVE-2024-56326
# Jinja2 sandbox escape via str.format - requires attacker to control template content
# Not applicable: We don't use sandboxed environment and don't allow user-controlled templates

CVE-2024-22195
# Jinja2 XSS vulnerability in xmlattr filter
# Not applicable: We use Jinja2 for backend templates only, not user-facing HTML

CVE-2025-27516
# Jinja2 sandbox breakout through attr filter
# Not applicable: Same reasoning as CVE-2024-56326 - we don't use sandbox mode

# Cryptography Library - No Fix Available
# =============================================================================
# Some cryptography CVEs may appear even with the latest version because:
# 1. The fix is pending upstream OpenSSL changes
# 2. The vulnerability is in rarely-used functionality
# Add specific CVEs here if they have no fix and are accepted risk

# =============================================================================
