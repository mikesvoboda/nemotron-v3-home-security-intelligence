# Flaky Tests Quarantine Manifest
# ================================
# Tests listed here are known to be flaky (fail intermittently) and are quarantined.
# Quarantined tests still run but their failures don't block CI.
#
# Format: One test node ID per line
# Example: backend/tests/unit/services/test_example.py::TestClass::test_method
#
# To add a test to quarantine:
# 1. Add the test node ID below
# 2. OR mark the test with @pytest.mark.flaky decorator
#
# To analyze flakiness:
# python scripts/analyze-flaky-tests.py flaky-test-results/
#
# Tests are automatically detected as flaky if they:
# - Fail then pass on retry (detected by pytest-rerunfailures)
# - Have a pass rate < 90% across multiple CI runs
#
# Review this file periodically and:
# - Fix the root cause of flakiness
# - Remove tests from quarantine once fixed
# - Add newly discovered flaky tests
