# Backend Data Directory - Agent Guide

## Purpose

The `backend/data/` directory stores runtime data for the home security intelligence system, including:

- Sample camera images for testing and development
- SQLite database files (when using default database URL)
- Log files (when using default log path)
- Generated thumbnails and other transient data

## Directory Structure

```
backend/data/
├── .gitkeep              # Ensures directory exists in git
├── cameras/              # Sample camera image directories
│   ├── front_door/       # Front door camera sample images
│   ├── driveway/         # Driveway camera sample images
│   └── backyard/         # Backyard camera sample images
├── thumbnails/           # Generated detection thumbnails (runtime)
├── security.db           # SQLite database (runtime, not in git)
├── security.db-wal       # SQLite WAL file (runtime, not in git)
├── security.db-shm       # SQLite shared memory file (runtime, not in git)
└── logs/                 # Log files (runtime, not in git)
    └── security.log      # Rotating application log
```

## Sample Camera Directories

The `cameras/` subdirectory contains sample images for development and testing:

### `cameras/front_door/`

Sample images simulating front door camera uploads:

- `capture_001.jpg` through `capture_005.jpg` - Sequential captures
- `new_capture_*.jpg` - Additional captures with timestamp naming

### `cameras/driveway/`

Sample images simulating driveway camera uploads:

- `capture_001.jpg` through `capture_005.jpg` - Sequential captures
- `motion_*.jpg` - Motion-triggered captures with timestamp naming

### `cameras/backyard/`

Sample images simulating backyard camera uploads:

- `capture_001.jpg` through `capture_005.jpg` - Sequential captures
- `alert_*.jpg` - Alert-triggered captures with timestamp naming

## Runtime Files (Not in Git)

These files are created at runtime and are not tracked in version control:

### SQLite Database Files

**`security.db`** - Main SQLite database containing:

- Cameras table
- Detections table
- Events table
- GPU stats table
- Logs table
- API keys table

**`security.db-wal`** - Write-ahead log for SQLite (WAL mode)
**`security.db-shm`** - Shared memory file for SQLite

### Thumbnail Files

**`thumbnails/`** - Generated detection thumbnails

- Format: `{detection_id}_thumb.jpg`
- Generated by thumbnail service during detection processing
- Includes bounding box overlays for detected objects
- Served via `/api/media/thumbnails/{filename}` endpoint

### Log Files

**`logs/security.log`** - Rotating application log file

- Configured via `LOG_FILE_PATH` setting
- Default max size: 10MB
- Default backup count: 7

## Configuration References

The data directory is referenced in configuration settings:

```python
# Default database URL (creates security.db in this directory)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./data/security.db

# Default log file path
LOG_FILE_PATH=data/logs/security.log
```

## Usage Notes

### Development Testing

The sample images in `cameras/` can be used with the file watcher to simulate camera uploads:

```python
# File watcher monitors directories matching camera folder_path
# When new files appear, they are queued for detection
```

### Database Location

For production deployments, consider using a different database location:

```bash
# Example: Store database in persistent volume
DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///var/data/security.db
```

### Disk Space Considerations

- SQLite WAL files can grow during heavy write activity
- Log files rotate but can accumulate if not cleaned
- Thumbnails and detection images are stored based on service configuration
