"""Contract tests for API compatibility verification.

This module contains contract tests that verify API responses conform to their
documented schemas using Schemathesis for property-based testing against the
OpenAPI specification.

Contract tests ensure:
- Response schemas match OpenAPI definitions
- Error responses follow documented patterns
- API compatibility is maintained across changes
