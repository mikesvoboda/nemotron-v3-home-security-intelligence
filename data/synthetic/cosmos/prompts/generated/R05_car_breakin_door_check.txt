Suburban home driveway at night, viewed from an elevated position on the garage. A person walks along parked cars, trying each door handle quietly, finds one unlocked, opens it, rummages inside briefly, then moves on. Subtle vehicle crime. Static elevated viewpoint, IR-tinted footage quality. Real-time speed, natural fluid motion at 1x playback rate.
