Suburban home backyard at midday, viewed from an elevated position under the roofline. A child quickly runs into the yard, grabs a soccer ball, waves apologetically toward neighboring house, and runs back out. Innocent brief intrusion. Static elevated viewpoint, clear daytime footage. Real-time speed, natural fluid motion at 1x playback rate.
