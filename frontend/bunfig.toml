# Bun Configuration

# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
# IMPORTANT: This project uses Vitest, not Bun's native test runner
# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
#
# ❌ DO NOT USE: bun test
# ✅ USE INSTEAD: bun run test (which invokes Vitest)
#
# Why 'bun test' doesn't work:
#
# 1. Tests use Vitest-specific APIs (vi.mock, vi.spyOn, etc.)
# 2. jsdom environment is configured in vite.config.ts (Vitest-specific)
# 3. Tests use Vitest's setupFiles (src/test/setup.ts)
# 4. Tests rely on @testing-library/jest-dom/vitest matchers
# 5. Bun's native test runner has incompatible APIs
#
# Errors you'll see with 'bun test':
# - "TypeError: mock(module, fn) requires a function"
# - "ReferenceError: document is not defined"
# - "TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'document[isPrepared]')"
#
# ✅ Correct test commands:
#
#   bun run test           # Run Vitest in watch mode
#   bun run test:coverage  # Run Vitest with coverage
#   bun run test:ui        # Open Vitest UI
#   npm test               # Also runs Vitest (same as bun run test)
