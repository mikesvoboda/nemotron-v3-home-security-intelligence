# This directory is for Docker secrets (e.g., postgres_password.txt)
# All files except .gitkeep are ignored for security.
#
# To use Docker secrets:
#   1. Generate a secure password:
#      openssl rand -base64 32 > secrets/postgres_password.txt
#
#   2. Set proper permissions:
#      chmod 600 secrets/postgres_password.txt
#
#   3. Uncomment the secrets sections in docker-compose.prod.yml
#
# See docs/admin-guide/security.md for more information.
