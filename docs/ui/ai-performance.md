The Grafana dashboard auto-refreshes based on its own configured interval. Use the "Refresh" button in the page header to force a reload.

## Key Metrics Explained

The Grafana dashboard displays metrics from the AI pipeline. Here's what each metric means:

### AI Model Health

**YOLO26 (Object Detection)**

- Detects people, vehicles, and animals in camera images
- Model: Real-Time Detection Transformer v2 (COCO + Objects365 pre-trained)
- Typical inference time: 30-50ms per image
- VRAM usage: ~4GB
- Health status: healthy, degraded, unhealthy, or unknown

**Nemotron (Risk Analysis LLM)**

- Analyzes detection batches to generate risk scores and explanations
- Production model: NVIDIA Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B (~14.7GB VRAM, 128K context)
- Development model: Nemotron Mini 4B Instruct (~3GB VRAM, 4K context)
- Typical inference time: 2-5 seconds per batch
- Runs via llama.cpp inference server on port 8091

### Latency Metrics

The dashboard tracks latency at multiple pipeline stages:

| Stage               | Description                                   | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Detection Inference | Time for YOLO26 to process one image          | 500ms             | 2000ms             |
| Analysis Inference  | Time for Nemotron to analyze a batch          | 5000ms            | 30000ms            |
| Watch to Detect     | File detection to detection result            | 100ms             | 500ms              |
| Detect to Batch     | Detection result to batch assignment          | 200ms             | 1000ms             |
| Batch to Analyze    | Batch closure to analysis completion          | 100ms             | 500ms              |
| Total Pipeline      | End-to-end from file upload to event creation | Varies            | Varies             |

**Expected end-to-end latency:**

- Fast path (high-confidence person): ~3-6 seconds
- Normal path (batched): 30-95 seconds (dominated by batch window)

### Queue Health

**Queue Depths** indicate processing backlog:

- Detection Queue: Images waiting for YOLO26 processing
- Analysis Queue: Batches waiting for Nemotron analysis

| Queue Depth | Status            | Meaning                   |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| < 10 items  | Healthy (green)   | Processing keeping up     |
| 10-50 items | Moderate (yellow) | Some backlog forming      |
| > 50 items  | Backlog (red)     | Processing cannot keep up |

**Throughput Counters:**

- Total Detections: Objects detected by YOLO26
- Total Events: Security events generated by the pipeline

**Error Monitoring:**

- Pipeline Errors: Failures by type (detection errors, analysis errors, etc.)
- Queue Overflows: Items dropped due to queue capacity limits
- Dead Letter Queue (DLQ): Failed jobs awaiting manual review or reprocessing

### Risk Score Distribution

Events are categorized by risk level:

| Risk Level | Score Range | Description                                        |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Low        | 0-30        | Normal activity, no concern                        |
| Medium     | 31-60       | Unusual but not threatening                        |
| High       | 61-80       | Suspicious activity requiring attention            |
| Critical   | 81-100      | Potential security threat, immediate action needed |

### Clickable Risk Score Bars

The risk score distribution chart is interactive. Each bar and count is clickable.

**How It Works:**

1. **Click any bar** in the chart to navigate to the Event Timeline
2. The Timeline automatically filters to show only events at that risk level
3. You can quickly investigate all events of a specific severity

| Click Target           | Navigates To                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Low bar/count**      | `/timeline?risk_level=low`      |
| **Medium bar/count**   | `/timeline?risk_level=medium`   |
| **High bar/count**     | `/timeline?risk_level=high`     |
| **Critical bar/count** | `/timeline?risk_level=critical` |

**Visual Feedback:**

- **Hover tooltip** - Shows "Click to view X events" on hover
- **Scale effect** - Bar slightly enlarges on hover
- **Pointer cursor** - Indicates the bar is clickable
- **Focus ring** - Green outline when using keyboard navigation

The bars are implemented as buttons for full keyboard accessibility (Tab to navigate, Enter/Space to select).

### Detection Class Distribution

Objects are detected in these security-relevant categories:

- **People**: person
- **Vehicles**: car, truck, bus, motorcycle, bicycle
- **Animals**: dog, cat, bird

## Model Zoo Section

The Model Zoo contains 18+ specialized AI models that enhance your security detections beyond basic object detection. These models extract additional details like license plates, faces, clothing, and vehicle types.

### Summary Bar

The Model Zoo summary bar at the top displays key statistics:

| Indicator    | Description                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Loaded**   | Models currently in GPU memory (green dot)   |
| **Unloaded** | Available models not currently loaded (gray) |
| **Disabled** | Temporarily disabled models (yellow)         |
| **VRAM**     | GPU memory usage (used/budget)               |

**VRAM (Video RAM)** is the GPU memory used by loaded models. The Model Zoo has a dedicated budget of 1650 MB separate from core AI models.

### Latency Chart

The latency chart shows inference time trends for any Model Zoo model:

1. **Select a model** using the dropdown menu at the top right
2. **View timing data** displayed as three lines:
   - **Avg (ms)** - Average inference time (emerald green)
   - **P50 (ms)** - Median inference time (blue)
   - **P95 (ms)** - 95th percentile time (amber)
3. **Time axis** shows the last 60 minutes of data

**Chart Legend:**

| Line Color  | Metric     | Meaning                                 |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Emerald** | Average    | Typical inference time                  |
| **Blue**    | P50/Median | Half of inferences are faster than this |
| **Amber**   | P95        | 95% of inferences are faster than this  |

> **No data?** If a model shows "No data available," it either has not been used recently or is disabled.

### Model Status Cards

Below the chart, each Model Zoo model appears as a status card with:

| Element          | Description                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model Name**   | Human-readable name of the model                   |
| **Status Dot**   | Color-coded health indicator                       |
| **Status Label** | Current state (Loaded, Unloaded, Loading, etc.)    |
| **VRAM**         | GPU memory required when loaded                    |
| **Last Used**    | Time since model was last used ("2h ago", "Never") |
| **Category**     | Model type (Detection, Classification, etc.)       |

### Model Status Indicators

| Status       | Dot Color      | Meaning                          |
| ------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Loaded**   | Green          | Model is in GPU memory and ready |
| **Loading**  | Blue (pulsing) | Model is currently being loaded  |
| **Unloaded** | Gray           | Model available but not loaded   |
| **Disabled** | Yellow         | Model is turned off              |
| **Error**    | Red            | Model failed to load             |

### Active vs Disabled Models

Models are organized into two sections:

- **Active Models** - Enabled and available for use
- **Disabled Models** - Turned off (grayed out, appear at bottom)

**Why are some models disabled?**

- Incompatible with current software versions
- Moved to a dedicated service
- Not yet released
- Temporarily turned off for maintenance

### Understanding Model Memory (VRAM)

Models load into your GPU's video memory (VRAM) when needed:

- **VRAM Budget:** 1650 MB for the Model Zoo
- **Loading Strategy:** One model loads at a time (sequential)
- **Automatic Management:** Models load/unload based on demand

**Why does this matter?**

- **Loaded models** respond instantly
- **Unloaded models** need time to load before first use
- **VRAM constraints** limit how many models can be loaded simultaneously

> **Note:** The core YOLO26 (~650 MB) and Nemotron (~21,700 MB) models have separate VRAM allocations and are always loaded.

### Model Zoo Analytics

Below the Model Zoo status cards, you see additional analytics:

#### Model Contribution Chart

A bar chart showing which models contribute most to event enrichment:

- **Higher bars** = More frequently used models
- **Sorted by contribution** = Most useful models at top
- **Hover for details** = See exact percentage

#### Model Leaderboard

### Refresh Settings

The AI Performance page relies on Grafana's built-in refresh mechanism. The dashboard's refresh interval is configured within Grafana itself.

| Setting           | Location                   | Description                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Dashboard Refresh | Grafana dashboard settings | Auto-refresh interval for the embedded dashboard |
| Manual Refresh    | Page header button         | Reloads the Grafana iframe on demand             |

**Note:** The standalone AI metrics components (available for other pages) use a 5-second polling interval with a 60-minute latency history window.

## Troubleshooting

### Grafana Dashboard Shows "Failed to Load"

1. Verify Grafana is running: `curl http://localhost:3002/api/health`
2. Check the backend config endpoint returns `grafana_url`: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/system/config`
3. Ensure network/firewall allows iframe embedding from Grafana
4. Check browser console for CORS or content security policy errors

### Model Shows "Unhealthy" Status

**YOLO26:**

1. Check if the detection server is running: `curl http://localhost:8090/health`
2. Verify GPU is available: `nvidia-smi`
3. Check container logs: `docker logs yolo26`
4. VRAM exhaustion may require restarting the service

**Nemotron:**

1. Check if llama.cpp server is running: `curl http://localhost:8091/health`
2. Verify model file exists and is valid
3. Check VRAM availability (Nemotron needs ~14.7GB for production model)
4. Review llama.cpp logs for memory allocation errors

### High Latency Detected

**Detection Latency > 500ms:**

- GPU may be under thermal throttling
- Check for other GPU workloads
- Verify CUDA is being used (not CPU fallback)

**Analysis Latency > 30s:**

- LLM context may be too large
- Consider reducing batch size
- Check if model is fully loaded in VRAM

**Queue Backlogs:**

- Processing cannot keep up with incoming images
- Consider scaling camera upload frequency
- Check for downstream service bottlenecks

### Dead Letter Queue Items Appearing

Items in the DLQ indicate failed processing jobs. To investigate:

1. Check the DLQ Monitor in Settings or use the API
2. Review the error messages for each failed job (includes error type, stack trace, HTTP status)
3. Common causes:
   - Temporary service unavailability
   - Malformed image files
   - LLM response parsing failures
   - Network timeouts

**DLQ API Endpoints:**

View DLQ statistics:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/dlq/stats
```

List jobs in a specific DLQ:

```bash
# Detection queue DLQ
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/dlq/jobs/dlq:detection_queue?start=0&limit=10"

# Analysis queue DLQ
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/dlq/jobs/dlq:analysis_queue?start=0&limit=10"
```

Requeue all jobs from a DLQ back to processing (requires API key if authentication enabled):

```bash
# Requeue detection queue DLQ items
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/dlq/requeue-all/dlq:detection_queue

# Requeue analysis queue DLQ items
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/dlq/requeue-all/dlq:analysis_queue
```

Clear a DLQ (permanently removes all jobs):

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/dlq/dlq:detection_queue
```

### Metrics Not Updating

1. Verify backend is healthy: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/system/health`
2. Check Prometheus metrics endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/metrics`
3. Verify Redis is connected (used for queue depth metrics)
4. Try manual refresh using the "Refresh" button

### Model Zoo Troubleshooting

#### Model Showing "Error" Status

**Symptoms:** Model card shows red dot and "Error" label.

**Possible causes:**

- Model file is missing or corrupted
- Insufficient GPU memory
- Model incompatible with current GPU

**What to do:**

1. Check the System page for GPU memory status
2. Note the model name and check system logs
3. Restart the AI service if multiple models show errors

#### Model Never Loads

**Symptoms:** Model stays "Unloaded" even when its function should trigger.

**Possible causes:**

- No detections that require this model (e.g., no license plates seen)
- Model is disabled in configuration
- Queue is backed up with other processing

**What to do:**

1. Check if the model is in the "Disabled Models" section
2. Wait for normal detection activity
3. Check the Pipeline Health panel for queue issues

#### High Latency on a Model

**Symptoms:** Latency chart shows consistently high times (P95 above 500ms for detection models).

**Possible causes:**

- GPU under heavy load
- Model being loaded/unloaded frequently
- Large number of objects in images

**What to do:**

1. Check GPU utilization on the System page
2. Look for patterns in the latency chart
3. Normal during high-activity periods

#### "No Data Available" for Model Latency

**Symptoms:** Latency chart shows "No data available for [model name]"

**This is normal when:**

- The model has not been used in the last hour
- The model is disabled
- No detections have triggered this model type

**What to do:**
Nothing - this is informational. Data appears when the model is used.

| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Backend Metrics   | `backend/core/metrics.py`               |
| System Routes     | `backend/api/routes/system.py`          |
| DLQ Routes        | `backend/api/routes/dlq.py`             |
| Detector Client   | `backend/services/detector_client.py`   |
| Nemotron Analyzer | `backend/services/nemotron_analyzer.py` |
| Batch Aggregator  | `backend/services/batch_aggregator.py`  |

**Note:** The standalone AI metrics components are exported from `frontend/src/components/ai/index.ts` and can be used on other pages that need to display AI metrics directly (without Grafana).

### GPU Requirements

| Service                 | Model                     | VRAM         | Port | Context Window |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------ | ---- | -------------- |
| YOLO26                  | yolo26_v2_r101vd          | ~4 GB        | 8090 | N/A            |
| Nemotron (Prod)         | Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B   | ~14.7 GB     | 8091 | 128K tokens    |
| Nemotron (Dev)          | Nemotron Mini 4B Instruct | ~3 GB        | 8091 | 4K tokens      |
| **Total (Production)**  |                           | **~18.7 GB** |      |                |
| **Total (Development)** |                           | **~7 GB**    |      |                |

The system is optimized for NVIDIA RTX A5500 (24GB VRAM) in production. For development, a GPU with 8GB+ VRAM is recommended.

**Production model advantages:**

- 128K context window enables analyzing hours of detection history in a single prompt
- Better reasoning quality for complex security scenarios
- Supports detailed enrichment data (clothing, vehicles, behavior patterns)

**Development model trade-offs:**

- Faster inference (~100-200 tokens/second vs ~50-100)
- Limited context requires more aggressive summarization
- Lower VRAM footprint allows running on consumer GPUs
