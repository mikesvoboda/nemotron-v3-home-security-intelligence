## Slide 1: The AI Accessibility Gap

**Core message:** Powerful AI exists, but most people believe it's not for them.

| Perception | Reality Today |
|------------|---------------|
| "AI requires expensive hardware" | Datacenter GPUs cost $30K+ |
| "AI means giving up privacy" | Ring, Eufy, ADT scandals prove the risk |
| "AI is too complex for regular users" | Most solutions require technical expertise |

**Bottom statement:**
> "NVIDIA has the technology to change this perception - today."

## Slide 2: Nemotron-3-Nano: AI for Everyone

**Core message:** The first intelligent home security system powered by local AI.

**The gap in the market:**
> "Today, home security cameras detect motion. They don't *understand* what they see."

| Capability | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| **True AI reasoning** | Not just "motion detected" - understands context, assigns risk scores, explains what's happening |
| **Runs locally** | 100% on-device using RTX GPUs millions already own - no cloud, no subscription |
| **Ready to deploy** | One-command install, works with existing IP cameras |

**Key differentiator:**
> "No product like this exists. Nemotron makes it possible."

**Supporting specs:**
- 30B parameters, 128K context | Datacenter reasoning at consumer scale | Open source (Apache 2.0)

## Slide 3: The Opportunity for NVIDIA

**Core message:** A free, open solution that reaches millions - and drives NVIDIA's AI ecosystem.

### Global Reach

| Reach Vector | Impact |
|--------------|--------|
| 100M+ IP cameras sold annually | Massive install base waiting for intelligence |
| Tens of millions of RTX GPUs in homes | Hardware is already deployed - just needs software |
| Open source (Apache 2.0) | No barrier to adoption - anyone can install today |

### Promotes NVIDIA's Ecosystem

| NVIDIA Asset | How This Showcases It |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **Nemotron-3-Nano** | First real-world consumer application of NVIDIA's flagship edge LLM |
| **RTX GPUs** | Proves consumer GPUs are AI-capable - not just for gaming |
| **CUDA / TensorRT** | Full NVIDIA-optimized inference stack |
| **RT-DETRv2** | Real-time object detection at 30-50ms |

### The Narrative NVIDIA Can Own

> "AI that protects your home. Private. Free. Powered by NVIDIA."
