## Template Instructions (DELETE THIS SECTION)

When creating a new AGENTS.md file:

1. **Replace all bracketed placeholders** with actual content
2. **Delete sections that don't apply** to your directory
3. **Add sections as needed** for your specific use case
4. **Keep it concise** - AGENTS.md files are for AI agents to quickly understand a directory
5. **Update the directory tree** to reflect actual file structure
6. **Include real examples** from the codebase when showing patterns

### Required Sections

At minimum, include:
- Purpose
- Key Files (or Directory Structure)
- Entry Points (if applicable)

### Optional Sections

Include if relevant:
- Patterns
- Dependencies
- Testing
- Common Tasks
- Related Documentation

### Style Guidelines

- Use tables for listing files with descriptions

- Keep descriptions brief but informative
- Link to related AGENTS.md files in subdirectories
- Reference external documentation when appropriate
